# StormChaser
DEMO: 3D Double-Helix localization software 

StormChaser is based on a c++ SM localization routine converted in a exectutable standalone .mex file.
Here only the .mex file is provided.

# Installation
StormChaser uses Matlab R2015 and a few scientific c++ libraries associated with it. 
To run the DEMO:
- Save all the files in the same directory
- Unzip the file StormChaser.rar
- Open the scrip named StormChaser_DEMO1.m
- Run the scrip following the instructions reported on the head of the StormChaser_DEMO1.m file

# Internal Workflow
fRapidDH.m is the main function.

### Preliminary steps:
- Parameters definition; 
- Find first guess for the seed threshold and the cluster threshold
    (the cluster thr: intensity value of the possible max peak 
      of a lobe
      the seed thr: value of intensity of the pixel belonging to a lobe);
- Test the choosen thresholds by checking the file generated by the 
    software with the images with a red cross overlapped to each found lobe
    or the images with the pixel corresponding to each lobe color with
    different colors

### Main steps:
1) DH-PSF calibration (dhCalibration.m)
2) molecule identification via lobes search (Center of mass approach) 
   and lobes pairing (CM_forDH)
3) first rejection and image segmentation preparetion for step 4)
  (lobePairRejection.m getParamLocInitGuess.m)
4) molecule localization via MLE fitting (MLElocalization.m)
5) filtering
6) Correction for spherical aberration
7) Intensity Conversion from ADU to photons
8) Result localizations displaying
9) Wobble correction
% 10) Result saving
